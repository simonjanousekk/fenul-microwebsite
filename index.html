        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Fenul is a sans-serif typeface with an elevated x-height which works
          in all sizes and for all purposes. Glyphs are constructed with
          geometrically circular forms and terminals are diagonal and tight.
          “Stem connections” have a reduced thickness while the remaining
          strokes stay in low contrast. Descenders and ascendersare short to
          make lines of texts look more compact. Subtle details are noticeable
          in several glyphs which could be inktraps, smiles or even haunting
          faces. Initially, this typeface was developed solely for fun without
          any agenda or specific aim in mind. The process was akin to the joy of
          spontaneouslykneading ceramic clay into different forms. The original
          idea was born in an airport terminal while buying a “TOBLERONE”
          chocolate bar, where the grotesque “R” is designed with petite serifs
          whose “sparks” in particular grabbed our attention. Design: Jana
          Papiernikova, Viktor Mizera Spacing and Kerning: Igino Marini First
          Sketch: 10/2020, Released: 10/2023 7 weights, 14 styles
